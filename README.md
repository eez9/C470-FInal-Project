In the amazing world of AI and machine learning, the evaluation of the classification algorithm, is important to check for the efficiency in that they would have in the real world. I went ahead and dived into the evaluation of three different classification algorithms which were Na√Øve Bayes, Logistic Regression and KNN I attempted to train and test each algorithm on the dataset gathered from the spambase.csv file. That file contained features that were gotten from emails that were viewed either as spam or not spam. This includes some attributes like frequencies, character frequencies and some other metrics.
